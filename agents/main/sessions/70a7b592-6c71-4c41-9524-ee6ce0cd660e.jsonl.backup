Also, can you come up with an exercise plan for me. I’m 240ish pounds and looking to get down to 210. The issue is I have very little free time between raising my son and work, so I’m trying to do as much as I can. Plus it’s super cold out. I have a lot of excuses of course, and I also have exercise induced anaphylaxis so it’s recommended by my doctor that I don’t exercise for 4 hours after I eat. If I wake up at 8, usually I have to feed my son which takes about an hour or commute to work (where I can’t do a big workout) which takes about 1.5 hours. In that time I get very hungry and almost always need coffee to awaken. Then that starts the 4 hours cycle but I also have work meetings that prevent exercise so then we’re at closer to 1 pm window where then I have meetings usually and I’ll get hungry and have lunch or more caffeine then we are now at 5-6 where I’m tasked with either cooking dinner or watching my son again until he goes to bed around 9. We usually have dinner between 6-7 pm so not sure how to fit this stuff in or what exercises to do. We have yoga mats, dumbbells, and a peloton. I’m trying to get an erg. It’s too cold and icy right now to run outside but I can take long indoor walks.\n[message_id: 167]"}],"timestamp":1768985148714}}

Let me break down what I understand:\n\n**Current stats:**\n- 240 lbs, goal 210 lbs (30 lb loss)\n- Exercise-induced anaphylaxis - can't exercise for 4 hours after eating\n\n**Schedule constraints:**\n- Wake: 8 AM\n- 8-9 AM: Feed son OR\n- 8-9:30 AM: Commute to work (can't do big workout during commute)\n- Gets hungry and needs coffee after waking → starts 4-hour cycle\n- Work meetings prevent exercise until ~1 PM\n- 1 PM: Usually has meetings, gets hungry, has lunch/caffeine → now pushed to 5-6 PM\n- 5-9 PM: Cooking dinner or watching son\n- Dinner: 6-7 PM → can't exercise until 10-11 PM\n- Son bedtime: ~9 PM\n\n**Equipment:**\n- Yoga mats\n- Dumbbells\n- Peloton\n- Trying to get an erg (rowing machine)\n- Can take long indoor walks\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Cold/icy outside - can't run outdoors\n- Very little free time\n- Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (4 hour post-meal buffer)\n\n**The key insight here:** The 4-hour eating restriction is the main constraint. Let me think about windows:\n\nOption 1: **Fasted morning workout (before eating anything)**\n- Wake at 8 AM\n- Exercise 8-8:30 AM BEFORE eating anything\n- Then feed son / commute\n- This could work if he can delay his first meal/coffee\n\nOption 2: **Late night workout**\n- If dinner is 6-7 PM, he could exercise at 10-11 PM\n- Son is in bed by 9 PM\n- This is late but possible\n\nOption 3: **Strategic fasting windows**\n- On some days, delay eating to create an afternoon window\n\n\n- A fasted morning session before coffee and breakfast seems most viable—even 15-20 minutes on the Peloton or with dumbbells would create momentum. The post-bedtime window at 10-11 PM is another option if he can sustain that energy late. On certain days, skipping lunch or having just black coffee could open up an afternoon slot, though that requires discipline around hunger and caffeine timing.\n\nWalking deserves consideration too—it's gentler on the system and fits naturally into his commute or as indoor movement on difficult days. The key is finding what he can actually sustain without triggering a reaction, then building a repeatable schedule around those windows.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"This is a puzzle, but it's solvable.

This is your cleanest window.\n\n---\n\n**Proposed Plan:**\n\n**OPTION A: Fasted Morning (Best)**\n- ⏰ 8:00-8:25 AM - Wake up, immediately do 20-25 min workout\n- No food/coffee yet (water is fine)\n- THEN eat breakfast / feed son / commute\n- Coffee after workout is your reward\n\n**What to do (rotate):**\n| Day | Workout | Equipment |\n|-----|---------|-----------|\n| Mon | Peloton - 20 min low-impact ride | Peloton |\n| Tue | Dumbbell circuit (squats, rows, press) | Dumbbells |\n| Wed | Long indoor walk (30+ min) or rest | - |\n| Thu | Peloton - 20 min ride | Peloton |\n| Fri | Dumbbell + yoga combo | Both |\n| Sat | Longer Peloton (30-45 min) | Peloton |\n| Sun | Rest or gentle yoga | Mat |\n\n---\n\n**OPTION B: Late Night (Backup)**\n- Dinner 6-7 PM → You're clear by **10-11 PM**\n- Son is asleep by 9\n- Do 20-30 min Peloton or dumbbells\n- Not ideal for sleep, but works in a pinch\n\n---\n\n**The Hard Truth About Your Excuses (said with love):**\n\nThe fasted morning workout requires ONE thing: **exercise before your first bite/sip of anything caloric.** \n\n- \"I need coffee to wake up\" → You'll wake up FAST on that Peloton, I promise. Coffee is the reward after.\n- \"I'm hungry\" → 20 minutes won't kill you. You'll survive.\n- \"It's cold\" → The Peloton is indoors 😄\n\n---\n\n**For Weight Loss Specifically:**\n\nExercise helps, but **diet is 80% of this battle.** At 240→210, you need roughly a 500 cal/day deficit over several months. \n\nWould you want me to help think through the nutrition side too, or keep this focused on movement?\n\n---\n\n**Want me to save this as a plan and check in on you periodically?** I can add gentle accountability nudges if that helps. 💪"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":1337,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14630,"totalTokens":15977,"cost":{"input":0.00005,"output":0.033425,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.0914375,"total":0.12491250000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1768985148716}}

But he wakes at 8 AM so maybe 8:05-8:10 AM to catch him right away.\n\nActually, let me think about timing:\n- 9:30 AM is already the Munger mental model\n- 8:30 AM Monday is weigh-in\n- Maybe I do 7:00 AM or 7:30 AM for the daily plan? Or right at 8 AM when he wakes?\n\nOr maybe I combine it - do the daily plan at like 8:00 AM as a quick \"today's focus\" message.\n\nLet me set up a daily 8:00 AM nudge with the day's plan/focus.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"Love it - daily action items.

I already know their style well:\n\n**Famous NY Post Headlines Examples:**\n- \"HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR\" (1983 - considered a masterpiece)\n- \"WEINER'S RISE AND FALL\" (Anthony Weiner scandal)\n- \"TIGER'S WOOD\" (Tiger Woods affair)\n- \"KA-BOOM!\" (various dramatic events)\n- \"THE CHUMP\" (political commentary)\n- \"CAPED FEAR\" (Batman movie)\n- \"AXIS OF WEASEL\" (France/Germany Iraq war opposition)\n- \"BEST EX\" (post-breakup)\n- \"BAG MEN\" (Boston bombing suspects)\n- \"COLD DEAD HANDS\" (gun control debate)\n- \"THEY DID THEIR WORST\" (various disasters)\n\nNY Post headline techniques:\n1. **Puns** - Word play on names, situations\n2. **Pop culture references** - Movie titles, songs, TV shows twisted\n3. **Rhymes** - Makes headlines memorable\n4. **Alliteration** - Catchy repetition of sounds\n5. **Short and punchy** - Usually 2-6 words max\n6. **Bold capitalization** - Visual impact\n7. **Irony/sarcasm** - Cutting commentary\n8. **Double meanings** - Headlines work on multiple levels\n9. **Name wordplay** - Using people's names in puns\n10. **Colloquialisms** - Everyday slang/phrases twisted\n\nLet me create a skill for this.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"I can see the covers page structure but the actual headlines are baked into the images.

Name Puns\nTurn someone's name into the headline:\n- **Weiner** → anything suggestive\n- **Trump** → trump card, trumped\n- **Swift** → swift action, swift kick\n\n### 2. Movie/Song Title Twists\nModify famous titles:\n- \"The Silence of the Hams\" (food scandal)\n- \"Apocalypse Cow\" (mad cow disease)\n- \"Honey, I Shrunk the Economy\"\n- \"Game of Phones\" (tech story)\n\n### 3. Rhymes & Alliteration\n- \"Dopes on Ropes\" (incompetent climbers)\n- \"Lyin' Ryan\" (politician caught lying)\n- \"Bezos Brings Bacon\" (Amazon profits)\n\n### 4. Classic Phrases Twisted\n- \"READ 'EM AND WEEP\" (bad news revealed)\n- \"SICK TRANSIT\" (subway problems)\n- \"HEAVEN CAN WAIT\" (celebrity survives)\n\n### 5. Onomatopoeia\n- BOOM!\n- SPLAT!\n- WHOOPS!\n- OUCH!\n\n### 6. One-Word Devastation\n- BUSTED\n- DOOMED\n- GOTCHA\n- GUILTY\n\n### 7. Sports Back Page Specials\nSports headlines are even more punny:\n- \"YANKS FOR NOTHING\" (Yankees lose)\n- \"METS MESS\" (Mets struggle)\n- \"GIANT MISTAKE\" (Giants loss)\n- \"KNICK KNACK\" (Knicks news)\n\n## How to Generate Headlines\n\nWhen given a news story:\n\n1. **Identify key names** - Can any be punned?\n2. **Find the emotion** - Anger? Shock? Triumph? Failure?\n3. **Think pop culture** - What movie/song/show fits?\n4. **Consider wordplay** - Homophones? Rhymes?\n5. **Generate 5-10 options** from different angles\n6. **Pick the most groan-worthy** - If it makes you wince, it's perfect\n\n## Output Format\n\nWhen asked for headlines, provide:\n\n```\n📰 HEADLINE OPTIONS:\n\n1. [MAIN HEADLINE] ⭐ (Best pick)\n   Technique: [what makes it work]\n\n2. [ALTERNATIVE]\n   Technique: [explanation]\n\n3. [ALTERNATIVE]\n   Technique: [explanation]\n\n(3-5 options, ranked by Post-worthiness)\n```\n\n## Front Page vs Back Page\n\n- **Front page**: News, politics, scandals - can be darker/edgier\n- **Back page**: Sports - pure pun territory, often celebratory or mocking\n\n## Rules\n\n1. **Shorter is better** - Every word must earn its place\n2. **Caps lock is your friend** - All headlines in CAPS\n3. **No explaining the joke** - If it needs explanation, it's not Post-worthy\n4. **Embrace the groan** - The best headlines make readers wince AND laugh\n5. **Nothing is sacred** - The Post headlined 9/11, pandemics, everything\n\n## Reference\n\nStudy more covers at: https://nypost.com/covers/\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":8,"output":1678,"cacheRead":25520,"cacheWrite":85156,"totalTokens":112362,"cost":{"input":0.00004,"output":0.04195,"cacheRead":0.012759999999999999,"cacheWrite":0.5322250000000001,"total":0.586975}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1768986657293}}

High level data flow of parlay RFQ works. Web/Mobile users will send parlay quote requests of a list of unique outcomes to ProphetX backend ProphetX will boradcast the requests to all integrated Service Providers (SPs) for a price quote through websocket, and quotes will be pushed to ProphetX through a callback restful api. Once user agree to the price, ProphetX will confirm prices with SPs that can satisfy the order through private websocekt. SPs are expecting to send confirmation to ProphetX through a callback restful api. After ProphetX receives the confirmation, a order.finalized msg will to pushed through private channel for the confirmation of parlay executed. API Documentation [https://parlay-docs-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/swagger/sp/index.html](https://parlay-docs-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/swagger/sp/index.html) Suggested integration steps: Example python code is in: [https://github.com/betprophet1/python-parlay-api-integration-guide](https://github.com/betprophet1/python-parlay-api-integration-guide) Example golang code is in : [https://github.com/betprophet1/prophet-parlay-integration-guide](https://github.com/betprophet1/prophet-parlay-integration-guide) Step 1: Follow first 3 steps on [this document](https://medium.com/@ProphetXServiceAPI/prophetx-service-api-integration-25694ebb369d)([https://medium.com/@ProphetXServiceAPI/prophetx-service-api-integration-25694ebb369d](https://medium.com/@ProphetXServiceAPI/prophetx-service-api-integration-25694ebb369d))to get MM api token/secrete and ingest sport events and markets. For Parlay api integration, the same MM api token/secrete is used. Get ProphetX Service API’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Subscribe Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Step 2: Connect to our Parlay specific websocket. See the “subscribe(self)” in python example and “ListenForMessages()” in golang example. There are 7 topics. price.ask.new, where parlay price quote request is broadcasted to all parties connected. The example callback payload is of format { 'parlay_id': price_quote_request['parlay_id'], 'offers': [ { 'valid_until': now_nanno, 'odds': 100000, 'max_risk': 200, \"estimated_price\": [{'line_id': x['line_id'], 'odds': 200} for x in lines] }, { 'valid_until': now_nanno, 'odds': 800, 'max_risk': 2000, \"estimated_price\": [{'line_id': x['line_id'], 'odds': 200} for x in lines] } ] } 2. price.confirm.new, where only parlay confirmation is sent to individual party to confirm the acceptance when user decided to accept the price. The example callback payload is of format { \"action\": \"accept\", //or reject \"confirmed_odds\": ...., \"confirmed_stake\": 100.0, // Optional. If null, no change to the stake \"price_probability\": [ { \"max_risk\": 200.0, \"lines\": [ { \"line_id\": \"line_1\", \"probability\": 0.5 }, { \"line_id\": \"line_2\", \"probability\": 0.4 } ], \"correlation\": ..., ??

The msg includes the last matched parlay odds and stake size from all SPs. Example msg: {“payload”: {“market_lines”: […], “matched_at”: 1759216871383341000, “matched_odds”: 188, “matched_stake”: 3.49,“parlay_id”: “28250d66–30a4–406b-b90c-cd65c96d4c72”, “timestamp”: 1759216871383340000} 4. order.finalized, once ProphetX receives the confirmation call back, this msg will be pushed to SP to confirm that the parlay has be executed on ProphetX side. Example payload of this msg. {“payload”:{“confirmed_odds”:-100000,”confirmed_stake”:1349.\n[message_id: 248]"}],"timestamp":1768998528808}}

It uses WebSocket for real-time communication.\n\n## Parlay API URLs\n| Environment | Base URL | Swagger |\n|-------------|----------|---------|\n| **Sandbox** | `https://api-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/parlay/sp` | https://parlay-docs-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/swagger/sp/index.html |\n\n## Example Code\n- **Python:** https://github.com/betprophet1/python-parlay-api-integration-guide\n- **Golang:** https://github.com/betprophet1/prophet-parlay-integration-guide\n\n## High-Level Flow\n1. User sends parlay quote request (list of outcomes) to ProphetX\n2. ProphetX broadcasts request to all connected SPs via WebSocket\n3. SPs respond with price quotes via callback REST API\n4. User accepts a price\n5. ProphetX sends confirmation to winning SP via private WebSocket\n6. SP confirms acceptance via callback REST API\n7. ProphetX sends `order.finalized` message confirming execution\n\n## WebSocket Topics\n\n### 1. `price.ask.new` (Broadcast)\nParlay quote request sent to ALL connected SPs.\n\n**Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"parlay_id\": \"83d790df-1ced-4490-a06a-7cb224faf59b\",\n  \"stake\": 3.49,\n  \"callback_url\": \"https://api-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/parlay/sp/order/offers\",\n  \"created_at\": 1744210012349577200,\n  \"market_lines\": [\n    {\"line_id\": \"abc123\", \"market_id\": 412, \"outcome_id\": 13, \"sport_event_id\": 30023691, \"line\": 5.5},\n    {\"line_id\": \"def456\", \"market_id\": 225, \"outcome_id\": 13, \"sport_event_id\": 20022121, \"line\": 227}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. `price.confirm.new` (Private)\nSent to individual SP when user accepts their price.\n\n**Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"callback_url\": \"https://...\",\n  \"odds\": 150,\n  \"action\": \"accept\"  // or \"reject\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. `order.matched` (Broadcast)\nSent to all SPs with matched parlay info.\n\n**Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"parlay_id\": \"28250d66-30a4-406b-b90c-cd65c96d4c72\",\n  \"matched_odds\": 188,\n  \"matched_stake\": 3.49,\n  \"matched_at\": 1759216871383341000,\n  \"market_lines\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. `order.finalized` (Private)\nConfirmation that parlay was executed.\n\n**Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"confirmed_odds\": -100000,\n  \"confirmed_stake\": 1349.00\n}\n```\n\n## Callback Endpoints\n\n### Price Offer Callback\n```\nPOST /parlay/sp/orders/offers\n```\nCalled by SP to submit price quote.\n\n**Request:**\n```json\n{\n  \"parlay_id\": \"parlay-uuid\",\n  \"offers\": [\n    {\n      \"valid_until\": 1744210517349577200,  // nanoseconds, must be >5 sec from now\n      \"odds\": 100000,\n      \"max_risk\": 200,\n      \"estimated_price\": [\n        {\"line_id\": \"abc123\", \"odds\": 200},\n        {\"line_id\": \"def456\", \"odds\": 200}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Price Confirmation Callback\n```\nPOST /parlay/sp/orders/confirmations\n```\nCalled by SP to accept/reject price confirmation.\n\n**Request:**\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"accept\",  // or \"reject\"\n  \"confirmed_odds\": 150,\n  \"confirmed_stake\": 100.0,  // optional\n  \"price_probability\": [\n    {\n      \"max_risk\": 200.0,\n      \"lines\": [\n        {\"line_id\": \"line_1\", \"probability\": 0.5},\n        {\"line_id\": \"line_2\", \"probability\": 0.4}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## REST Endpoints\n\n### List Orders\n```\nGET /parlay/sp/orders\n```\n**Query params:** limit, token (pagination), from, to, relative (e.g. \"15m\"), status\n\n**Statuses:** open, confirmed, completed, canceled, settled, void, finalized, rejected, inactive\n\n### Send Supported Lines\n```\nPOST /parlay/sp/supported-lines\n```\nTell ProphetX which lines you can price.\n```json\n{\n  \"supported_lines\": [\"line_id_1\", \"line_id_2\", ...]\n}\n```\n\n## WebSocket Setup\n\n1. **Get connection config:**\n   ```\n   GET /websocket/connection-config\n   ```\n\n2. **Authenticate WebSocket:**\n   ```\n   POST /parlay/pusher\n   ```\n   With `socket_id` from Pusher connection.\n\n3. **Subscribe to channels:**\n   - Broadcast channel: `price.ask.new`\n   - Private channel: `price.confirm.new`, `order.finalized`\n\n## Integration Steps\n1. Login with MM API credentials (same keys work for both APIs)\n2. Seed tournaments/events/markets from MM API\n3. Connect to Parlay WebSocket\n4. Subscribe to broadcast + private channels\n5.

User sends parlay quote request (list of outcomes) to ProphetX\n+377 2. ProphetX broadcasts request to all connected SPs via WebSocket\n+378 3. SPs respond with price quotes via callback REST API\n+379 4. User accepts a price\n+380 5. ProphetX sends confirmation to winning SP via private WebSocket\n+381 6. SP confirms acceptance via callback REST API\n+382 7. ProphetX sends `order.finalized` message confirming execution\n+383 \n+384 ## WebSocket Topics\n+385 \n+386 ### 1. `price.ask.new` (Broadcast)\n+387 Parlay quote request sent to ALL connected SPs.\n+388 \n+389 **Payload:**\n+390 ```json\n+391 {\n+392   \"parlay_id\": \"83d790df-1ced-4490-a06a-7cb224faf59b\",\n+393   \"stake\": 3.49,\n+394   \"callback_url\": \"https://api-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/parlay/sp/order/offers\",\n+395   \"created_at\": 1744210012349577200,\n+396   \"market_lines\": [\n+397     {\"line_id\": \"abc123\", \"market_id\": 412, \"outcome_id\": 13, \"sport_event_id\": 30023691, \"line\": 5.5},\n+398     {\"line_id\": \"def456\", \"market_id\": 225, \"outcome_id\": 13, \"sport_event_id\": 20022121, \"line\": 227}\n+399   ]\n+400 }\n+401 ```\n+402 \n+403 ### 2. `price.confirm.new` (Private)\n+404 Sent to individual SP when user accepts their price.\n+405 \n+406 **Payload:**\n+407 ```json\n+408 {\n+409   \"callback_url\": \"https://...\",\n+410   \"odds\": 150,\n+411   \"action\": \"accept\"  // or \"reject\"\n+412 }\n+413 ```\n+414 \n+415 ### 3. `order.matched` (Broadcast)\n+416 Sent to all SPs with matched parlay info.\n+417 \n+418 **Payload:**\n+419 ```json\n+420 {\n+421   \"parlay_id\": \"28250d66-30a4-406b-b90c-cd65c96d4c72\",\n+422   \"matched_odds\": 188,\n+423   \"matched_stake\": 3.49,\n+424   \"matched_at\": 1759216871383341000,\n+425   \"market_lines\": [...]\n+426 }\n+427 ```\n+428 \n+429 ### 4. `order.finalized` (Private)\n+430 Confirmation that parlay was executed.\n+431 \n+432 **Payload:**\n+433 ```json\n+434 {\n+435   \"confirmed_odds\": -100000,\n+436   \"confirmed_stake\": 1349.00\n+437 }\n+438 ```\n+439 \n+440 ## Callback Endpoints\n+441 \n+442 ### Price Offer Callback\n+443 ```\n+444 POST /parlay/sp/orders/offers\n+445 ```\n+446 Called by SP to submit price quote.\n+447 \n+448 **Request:**\n+449 ```json\n+450 {\n+451   \"parlay_id\": \"parlay-uuid\",\n+452   \"offers\": [\n+453     {\n+454       \"valid_until\": 1744210517349577200,  // nanoseconds, must be >5 sec from now\n+455       \"odds\": 100000,\n+456       \"max_risk\": 200,\n+457       \"estimated_price\": [\n+458         {\"line_id\": \"abc123\", \"odds\": 200},\n+459         {\"line_id\": \"def456\", \"odds\": 200}\n+460       ]\n+461     }\n+462   ]\n+463 }\n+464 ```\n+465 \n+466 ### Price Confirmation Callback\n+467 ```\n+468 POST /parlay/sp/orders/confirmations\n+469 ```\n+470 Called by SP to accept/reject price confirmation.\n+471 \n+472 **Request:**\n+473 ```json\n+474 {\n+475   \"action\": \"accept\",  // or \"reject\"\n+476   \"confirmed_odds\": 150,\n+477   \"confirmed_stake\": 100.0,  // optional\n+478   \"price_probability\": [\n+479     {\n+480       \"max_risk\": 200.0,\n+481       \"lines\": [\n+482         {\"line_id\": \"line_1\", \"probability\": 0.5},\n+483         {\"line_id\": \"line_2\", \"probability\": 0.4}\n+484       ]\n+485     }\n+486   ]\n+487 }\n+488 ```\n+489 \n+490 ## REST Endpoints\n+491 \n+492 ### List Orders\n+493 ```\n+494 GET /parlay/sp/orders\n+495 ```\n+496 **Query params:** limit, token (pagination), from, to, relative (e.g. \"15m\"), status\n+497 \n+498 **Statuses:** open, confirmed, completed, canceled, settled, void, finalized, rejected, inactive\n+499 \n+500 ### Send Supported Lines\n+501 ```\n+502 POST /parlay/sp/supported-lines\n+503 ```\n+504 Tell ProphetX which lines you can price.\n+505 ```json\n+506 {\n+507   \"supported_lines\": [\"line_id_1\", \"line_id_2\", ...]\n+508 }\n+509 ```\n+510 \n+511 ## WebSocket Setup\n+512 \n+513 1. **Get connection config:**\n+514    ```\n+515    GET /websocket/connection-config\n+516    ```\n+517 \n+518 2. **Authenticate WebSocket:**\n+519    ```\n+520    POST /parlay/pusher\n+521    ```\n+522    With `socket_id` from Pusher connection.\n+523 \n+524 3. **Subscribe to channels:**\n+525    - Broadcast channel: `price.ask.new`\n+526    - Private channel: `price.confirm.new`, `order.finalized`\n+527 \n+528 ## Integration Steps\n+529 1.

Affiliate api documentation: https://partner-docs.prophetx.co/swagger/affiliate/index.html Recommended steps: get production affiliate api token from ProphetX if you do not have one yet. call “get_sport_events” to get a list of events of a tournament call “get_multiple_markets” to get markets of a list of events, example output attached. Make sure the line_id is recorded, as it is needed to make plays later. Example output: { \"data\": { \"10073803\": [ { \"display_name\": \"Total Runs\", \"id\": 258, \"line\": 7.5, \"name\": \"Fixed total 7.5\", \"selections\": [ { \"display_line\": \"7.5\", \"display_name\": \"under 7.5\", \"display_odds\": \"+119\", \"line\": 7.5, \"line_id\": \"40a32ae7b39684d430cf494be26cbe6b\", \"name\": \"under 7.5\", \"odds\": 119, \"outcome_id\": 13, \"stake\": 42.81, \"updated_at\": 1728663193784820000, \"value\": 32.61 }, { \"display_line\": \"7.5\", \"display_name\": \"over 7.5\", \"display_odds\": \"-122\", \"line\": 7.5, \"line_id\": \"7d8bbf46022a2329f792a2e0dfb18408\", \"name\": \"over 7.5\", \"odds\": -122, \"outcome_id\": 12, \"stake\": 32.46, \"updated_at\": 1728659738559788000, \"value\": 39.6 } ], \"type\": \"total\" }, ......, { \"display_name\": \"1st-5th Inning Spread\", \"favourite\": true, \"id\": 275, \"line\": -0.5, \"name\": \"Fixed home -0.5\", \"selections\": [ { \"competitor_id\": 10000001, \"display_line\": \"-0.5\", \"display_name\": \"Los Angeles Dodgers -0.5\", \"display_odds\": \"+103\", \"line\": -0.5, \"line_id\": \"5cfa3fd055082c25448ed0bdee083092\", \"name\": \"Los Angeles Dodgers -0.5\", \"odds\": 103, \"outcome_id\": 1714, \"stake\": 702.05, \"updated_at\": 1728662243408684000, \"value\": 681.6 }, { \"competitor_id\": 10000033, \"display_line\": \"+0.5\", \"display_name\": \"San Diego Padres +0.5\", \"display_odds\": \"-111\", \"line\": 0.5, \"line_id\": \"48470acfbf067d1dc8c76d4692315c34\", \"name\": \"San Diego Padres +0.5\", \"odds\": -111, \"outcome_id\": 1715, \"stake\": 13.89, \"updated_at\": 1728662243408817000, \"value\": 15.42 } ], \"type\": \"spread\" } ] } } 2. Manage user session This step does not need to store user’s email and password, but would need user to enter their email/password once every 30 days. Get ProphetX Service API’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Subscribe Recommended steps: pop out a modal to ask user to enter ProphetX email/password to connect to ProphetX call “https://cash.api.prophetx.co/api/v1/auth/login” by using user provided email/password to get two tokens “accessToken” and “refreshToken”. The “accessToken” expires within 1 hour, and “refreshToken” valid for 30 days. Store the “refreshToken” and “accessToken” on your server side. Once “refreshToken” expires, use endpoint “https://cash.api.prophetx.co/api/v1/auth/extend-session” to get a new refreshToken using the accessToken. In the request, you can use “Bearer <previous refreshToken>” as Authorization. A valid refreshToken is needed to make plays. You can see this api get called in https://www.prophetx.co by leaving a logged in tab for 1+ hours and then do a refresh, this api would be called to get a new refreshToken. After 30 days accessToken is created, or your side failed to get a new refreshToken using the existing accessToken, ask user to repeat step 1. 3. Geolocation check The geolocation check can be implemented like following: Press enter or click to view image in full size Geocomply integration example Replace the “src” part from above screenshot for the geocomply library by “https://cdn.geocomply.com/224/gc-html5.js\" 2. Call https://cash.api.prophetx.co/api/v1/geocomply/license?isSecure=true to get prophet license, this is a one time license, need to get a new one for each geolocation request. 3. Call https://cash.api.prophetx.co/api/v1/me to get user id 4. Follow image “Geocomply integration example” to make the geolocation request using above user id and license from step 2. 5. Once get response, call https://cash.api.prophetx.co/api/v1/geocomply/decrypt to get decrypted response + ProphetX special logic 6. Make sure <error_code>0</error_code> and “isActiveStates”: true, then user is allowed to make a play. If not satisfied, user geolocation failed, and your platform can ask them to manually trigger the geolocation request again. Example response: {\"text\": \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?> <nodes> <gc_transaction>8b21cb1d4e54d0de</gc_transaction> <error_code>0</error_code> <error_message/> <sdk solution=\\\"Solus\\\" os=\\\"Mac\\\"/> <geolocate_in>1800</geolocate_in> <buffer_time>35</buffer_time><conn_type>static</conn_type> <mac_address>unknown</mac_address> <device_uuid>1726663819576–07167EAD-AC76–4DCC-854C-CBCB40926D25</device_uuid> <ip ipaddress=\\\"45.122.19.131\\\" proxyscore=\\\"0.00\\\" lat=\\\"41.8108\\\" lon=\\\"-71.3667\\\" acc=\\\"100000\\\" country_code=\\\"US\\\" country=\\\"United States\\\" region_code=\\\"NY\\\" region=\\\"New York\\\" city=\\\"Huntington Station\\\" err=\\\"0\\\" secondary=\\\"1\\\"/><wifi lat=\\\"40.82496\\\" lon=\\\"-71.45789\\\" acc=\\\"33.145748641574\\\" country_code=\\\"US\\\" country=\\\"United States\\\" region_code=\\\"NY\\\" region=\\\"New York\\\" city=\\\"\\\" street=\\\"Main Street\\\" err=\\\"0\\\" primary=\\\"1\\\" dist_to_border=\\\"31591.854251358\\\"/><gsm lat=\\\"\\\" lon=\\\"\\\" acc=\\\"\\\" country_code=\\\"\\\" country=\\\"\\\" region_code=\\\"\\\" region=\\\"\\\" city=\\\"\\\" street=\\\"\\\" err=\\\"202\\\"/><gps lat=\\\"\\\" lon=\\\"\\\" acc=\\\"\\\" country_code=\\\"\\\" country=\\\"\\\" region_code=\\\"\\\" region=\\\"\\\" city=\\\"\\\" street=\\\"\\\" err=\\\"202\\\"/> <user_id>78d76eaf-3227–4045–8c6a-5e6fa3cc8a26</user_id> <reason>Verfiy geo location</reason><user_session_id/> <custom_fields> <custom_field id=\\\"email\\\">someemail+test@betprophet.co</custom_field> <custom_field id=\\\"phoneNumber\\\">2348232834</custom_field> </custom_fields><timestamp>2024–09–30T15:00:52.672Z</timestamp> <akey>ProphetXProd</akey></nodes> \", \"isActiveStates\": true, \"errorMessage\": \"\"} 4. Make plays Once geolocation check from above step succeeds, then user is then legally allowed to make plays on our platform through your website. Recommended steps: Make sure user is geolocated successfully from previous step. From the event/market data ingested in step 1 to find the specific line_id that user is interested in to play. Upon user click the specific event/market/line/side, then pop out a window to ask user to enter Prophet Cash amount and odds, which can be default to the best odds your side shows. If refreshToken is expired, get a new refreshtoken using accessToken. Call “https://cash.api.prophetx.co/trade/private/api/v2/wagers” by providing “lineID”, “odds”, “stake” as the payload. Please go to our website https://www.prophetx.co/?currency=cash to place a 1 ProphetCash play and see the authorization and payload details. 5. Send tracking data to ProphetX In order to better track the performance of integration effectively, please implement the equivalent of this curl command on your side for each play placed. The <user_id> can bet from the /me endpoint, and the refId is from the play placement response. curl --request POST \\ --url https://track.customer.io/api/v1/customers/<user_id>/events \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization:Basic ZWQxMDdkMTYxMDgwN2E0YWQyNTA6ZjBiMzFhNjc1YjkwNTlmMGMwMTc=' \\ --data '{\"name\":\"Bet Placed\",\"data\":{\"wager_id\": “<wager_refId>\", \"bet_placement_location\": \"beeBettor\"}}' Press enter or click to view image in full size\n[message_id: 254]"}],"timestamp":1768998606651}}

After placing a play through the REST API, record the wager ID. You will shortly receive a confirmation message through a private channel indicating whether the play was activated successfully or failed. The most common failure reason is insufficient wallet balance. Safety Protection If you don’t receive a play activation message within 10 seconds of placement, it could be due to a WebSocket disconnection or a lost message. Please reconnect the WebSocket and call the REST API mm/get_wager/{wager_id} to retrieve the play status. Play Cancellation Confirmation Get ProphetX Service API’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Subscribe After canceling a single wager or a batch of plays, a successful cancellation will return a 200 response, indicating the plays are canceled and cannot be matched anymore. A confirmation message will also be sent through the private WebSocket channel, including details on which plays were canceled. Attempting to cancel an already canceled play will result in a 400 error. Order Book Real-Time Construction To construct the order book of a market and track matching activities, subscribe to the message market_selection on the broadcast channel. We recommend calling the REST APIs mm/get_markets or mm/get_multiple_markets once every 15 minutes to compare with your WebSocket-constructed order book. This helps prevent inaccuracies caused by missed WebSocket messages. You can also subscribe to matched_bet topic in the same broadcast channel to get real time matching details. When market liquidity updated it could mean play cancelled or matched, and a matched_bet msg, including odds and amount matched, will be send through the broadcast channel if it is caused by matching. Risk Control in Real-Time Matching updates for your plays are pushed to you through a private channel. These messages include details like wager ID, amount matched, and matched odds. Your system can use this information to rebalance the your own book and minimize exposure in real-time. Ensure WebSocket Connectivity A disconnect event is typically sent when the WebSocket connection is lost. To prevent false positives, you can also listen to the public message health_check, which broadcasts every 5 seconds. If you rely on this message, we recommend disconnecting and reconnecting the WebSocket if no health_check message is received for more than 30 seconds.\n[message_id: 256]"}],"timestamp":1768998646343}}

Wager Object This object returns from a couple of endpoints, for example place_wager, place_multiple_wagers, get_wager_histories, websocket events … This object has four fields of enum types, status, matching_status, winning_status, update_status. status inactive, play request is received, but still in the validation process and not able to be matched or seen by any client yet. open, play passed validation, and able to be seen by clients and able to be matched by other users. invalid, play failed validation, and never become available for any user to see. Most common reason is not enough wallet balance during activation. canceled, play was cancelled by client, and this play did not have any amount matched. If this play was partially matched, after the the cancellation, partial amount is cancelled. This play status will still be open, and matching_status will become fully_matched. void, play was explicated voided by internal operation team out of regulation requirements or other causes. wiped, play was wiped automatically once certain event happens, for example all pre-match plays get wiped once a game transits from pre-match to live. manually_settled, play was not auto settled because of data source issue or some existing limitations, and human intervention was needed to settle these play. settled, auto-settled winning play will have this status. Once wallet balance is updated, status will transition to closed closed, final status for auto-settled plays. Auto-settled losing plays will go directly to closed. Play flow examples: 1. for winning auto-settled play: inactive => open => settled => closed 2. for losing auto-settled plays: inactive => open => closed 3. for all manually settled plays: inactive => open => manually_settled matching_status unmatched, the play is not matched with any other play yet. partially_matched, only partial amount of the play is matched with other play(s). fully_matched, full amount of the play is matched is with another play(s).

Api status Page: https://ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/api-status?currency=cash End Integration demo: Note: If you are already in contact with the Prophet Exchange team, you can get a sandbox account by contacting a team member via Slack or email doug.myers@betprophet.co For more information on how to become an API user, you can also contact Doug for more details. In this article we are going through the integration in the sandbox environment, which will include demo funds for testing purposes. Register at https://ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/register Press enter or click to view image in full size Since this is a sandbox environment, we do not need to worry if the birthday or address is wrong, but do make sure the phone number is correct as 2FA is needed even for the sandbox registration. Contact us to request them to set your account to be an API account and add some testing funds. You can reach out to doug.myers@betprophet.co or hello@betprophet.co. Generate Api tokens After your account is approved as an API account, now we are ready to generate tokens for the API integrations. Start a new session and log into https://ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/ with your credentials Click the top right toggle, navigate to the Prophet Cash side, and click “API integration” in the dropdown, 3. Click “create a new token”. Multiple tokens can be created, and each token can have multiple sessions. Multiple tokens can be used for different integration processes, and gives the freedom to revoke one of them without affecting all other integrations. In the future updates, each token will also have different permissions, so more specifc controls can be available. Integration Steps: Github code: https://github.com/betprophet1/mm-api-integration-guide Api documents: Sandbox: https://partner-docs-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/swagger/mm/index.html Keys needed: Access Key: part of Api key Secret Key: another part of the Api key Base url: Unique for each environment. Sandbox: https://api-ss-sandbox.betprophet.co/partner Major steps: Exchange a session key by using Access Key and Secret Key (optional) get your current wallet balance Seeding events based on tournaments you want to play Subscribe to web socket to get updates on sports events, market liquidity, and more Start to place/cancel plays Step 1: Exchange session keys by using Access Key and Secret Key Endpoint: partner/auth/login Before we can call any other APIs, we need to exchange a short lived (20 minutes) access token, and relatively long lived (3 days) refresh token using the access key and secrete key combination. This access token need to be provided for all following transactions, including subscribing to web sockets. Example code: def mm_login(self) -> dict: \"\"\"' Login to MM API, and store session keys in self.mm_session \"\"\" login_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_login']) request_body = { 'access_key': self.mm_keys.get('access_key'), 'secret_key': self.mm_keys.get('secret_key'), } response = requests.post(login_url, data=json.dumps(request_body)) if response.status_code != 200: logging.debug(response) logging.debug(\"Please check your access key and secrete key to the user_info.json\") raise Exception(\"login failed\") mm_session = json.loads(response.content)['data'] logging.info(mm_session) self.mm_session = mm_session logging.info(\"MM session started\") return mm_sessionAuthentication in all APIs are through the header, def __get_auth_header(self) -> dict: return { 'Authorization': f'Bearer ' f'{self.mm_session[\"access_token\"]}', } Step 2: (optional) get your current wallet balance Endpoint: partner/mm/get_balance Get ProphetX Service API’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Subscribe Just in case you are interested in how much money left in wallet, a quick endpoint to get available balances. Example code: def get_balance(self): balance_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_balance']) response = requests.get(balance_url, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if response.status_code != 200: logging.error(\"failed to get balance\") return self.balance = json.loads(response.content).get('data', {}).get('balance', 0) logging.info(f\"still have ${self.balance} left\") Step 3: Seeding events based on tournaments you want to play Endpoints: partner/mm/get_tournaments partner/mm/get_sport_events partner/mm/get_markets partner/mm/get_multiple_markets The get_tournaments endpoints returns a list of tournaments the company supports. Refer to “Api documents” for various options. The id of tournament is needed to call the second endpoint get_sports_events to get a list of events that are currently open to play. The same tournament id is needed for next step to subscribe to their web socket channels to get updates. Take MLB for example, in the code we find the id for MLB, and then get all active events of the tournament. Example code: def seeding(self): \"\"\" 1. Get odds ladder, as only wagers having odds in the odds ladder are allowed. 2. Get all tournaments/events and markets details of each event. :return: \"\"\" logging.info(\"start to get odds ladder\") odds_ladder_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_odds_ladder']) odds_response = requests.get(odds_ladder_url, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if odds_response.status_code != 200: logging.info(\"not able to get valid odds from api, fall back to local constants\") self.valid_odds = constants.VALID_ODDS_BACKUP else: self.valid_odds = odds_response.json()['data'] # initiate available tournaments/sport_events # tournaments logging.info(\"start seeding tournaments/events/markets\") t_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_tournaments']) headers = self.__get_auth_header() all_tournaments_response = requests.get(t_url, headers=headers) if all_tournaments_response.status_code != 200: raise Exception(\"not able to seed tournaments\") all_tournaments = json.loads(all_tournaments_response.content).get('data', {}).get('tournaments', {}) self.all_tournaments = all_tournaments # get sport events and markets of each event event_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_events']) multiple_markets_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_multiple_markets']) for one_t in all_tournaments: if one_t['name'] in config.TOURNAMENTS_INTERESTED: self.my_tournaments[one_t['id']] = one_t events_response = requests.get(event_url, params={'tournament_id': one_t['id']}, headers=headers) if events_response.status_code == 200: events = json.loads(events_response.content).get('data', {}).get('sport_events') if events is None: continue event_ids = ','.join([str(event['event_id']) for event in events]) # instead of getting markets of one event at a time, # using get_multiple_markets to batch get markets of a list of events multiple_markets_response = requests.get(multiple_markets_url, params={'event_ids': event_ids}, headers=headers)if multiple_markets_response.status_code == 200: map_market_by_event_id = json.loads(multiple_markets_response.content).get('data', {}) for event in events: event['markets'] = map_market_by_event_id[str(event['event_id'])] self.sport_events[event['event_id']] = event logging.info(f'successfully get markets of events {event[\"name\"]}') else: logging.info(f'failed to get markets of events ids: {\",\".join([str(event[\"event_id\"]) for event in events])}') else: logging.info(f'skip tournament {one_t[\"name\"]} as api request failed') logging.info(\"Done, seeding\") logging.info(f\"found {len(self.my_tournaments)} tournament, ingested {len(self.sport_events)} \" f\"sport events from {len(config.TOURNAMENTS_INTERESTED)} tournaments\") Step 4: Subscribe to web sockets to get updates on sports events and market liquidity. Websocket is powered by Pusher (https://pusher.com/) under the hood. Get connection-config: 1. Use endpoint /partner/websocket/connection-config to get connection info (it will include key, app_id and cluster_id used to create connection to pusher in below section) Endpoints: partner/mm/pusher In order to get sport event and market liquidity updates, we need to subscribe to their web socket to get these information pushed back to us. There are mostly two channels we need to subscribe to broadcast channel (private-broadcast-service=3-device_type=5), where same information get pushed to all Market Makers. private channel (private-service=3-device_type=5-user=<partnerId>), where information on your wagers are pushed through No need to construct these two channels explicitly, the endpoint “partner/mm/pusher” can be called directly to get these two channels, and events that are available in each channel. In this example, I subscribed to all tournaments updates, but only provided call back for tournaments I am interested in, which is achieved to only bind to specific msg topic. In my case MLB has id 109, so I bind to “tournaments_109”. Example code: def _get_channels(self, socket_id: float): \"\"\" Get a list of all channels and topics of each channel that you are allowing to subscribe to. Even though there are public and private channels, but the channel id is unique for each API user. \"\"\" auth_endpoint_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_auth']) channels_response = requests.post(auth_endpoint_url, data={'socket_id': socket_id}, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if channels_response.status_code != 200: logging.error(\"failed to get channels\") raise Exception(\"failed to get channels\") channels = channels_response.json() return channels.get('data', {}).get('authorized_channel', []) def _get_connection_config(self): \"\"\" Get websocket connection configurations. We are using Pusher as our websocket service, and only authenticated channels are used. More details can be found in https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/user-authentication/. The connection configuration is designed for stability and infrequent updates. However, in the unlikely event of a Pusher cluster incident, we will proactively migrate to a new cluster to ensure uninterrupted service. To maintain optimal connectivity, we recommend users retrieve the latest connection configuration at least once every thirty minutes. If the retrieved configuration remains unchanged, no further action is required. In the event of a new configuration being discovered, users should update their connection accordingly. \"\"\" connection_config_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['websocket_config'])connection_response = requests.get(connection_config_url, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if connection_response.status_code != 200: logging.error(\"failed to get connection configs\") raise Exception(\"failed to get channels\") conn_configs = connection_response.json() return conn_configs def subscribe(self): \"\"\" 1. get Pusher connection configurations 2. connect to Pusher websocket service by providing authentication credentials 3. waiting for the websocket connection successful handshake and then execute connect_handler in the callback 4. subscribe to public channels on selected topics 5. subscribe to private channels on all topics \"\"\" connection_config = self._get_connection_config() # not working yet, getting wrong config key = connection_config['key'] cluster = connection_config['cluster'] auth_endpoint_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_auth']) auth_header = self.__get_auth_header() auth_headers = { \"Authorization\": auth_header['Authorization'], \"header-subscriptions\": '''[{\"type\":\"tournament\",\"ids\":[]}]''', } self.pusher = pysher.Pusher(key=key, cluster=cluster, auth_endpoint=auth_endpoint_url, auth_endpoint_headers=auth_headers) def public_event_handler(*args, **kwargs): print(\"processing public, Args:\", args) print(f\"event details {base64.b64decode(json.loads(args[0]).get('payload', '{}'))}\") print(\"processing public, Kwargs:\", kwargs) def private_event_handler(*args, **kwargs): print(\"processing private, Args:\", args) print(f\"event details {base64.b64decode(json.loads(args[0]).get('payload', '{}'))}\") print(\"processing private, Kwargs:\", kwargs) # We can't subscribe until we've connected, so we use a callback handler # to subscribe when able def connect_handler(data): socket_id = json.loads(data)['socket_id'] available_channels = self._get_channels(socket_id) broadcast_channel_name = None private_channel_name = None private_events = None for channel in available_channels: if 'broadcast' in channel['channel_name']: broadcast_channel_name = channel['channel_name'] else: private_channel_name = channel['channel_name'] private_events = channel['binding_events'] broadcast_channel = self.pusher.subscribe(broadcast_channel_name) private_channel = self.pusher.subscribe(private_channel_name) for t_id in self.my_tournaments: event_name = f'tournament_{t_id}' broadcast_channel.bind(event_name, public_event_handler) logging.info(f\"subscribed to public channel, event name: {event_name}, successfully\") for private_event in private_events: private_channel.bind(private_event['name'], private_event_handler) logging.info(f\"subscribed to private channel, event name: {private_event['name']}, successfully\") self.pusher.connection.bind('pusher:connection_established', connect_handler) self.pusher.connect() Step 5: Start to place/cancel plays Endpoints: partner/mm/place_wager partner/mm/cancel_wager partner/mm/place_batch_wagers partner/mm/cancel_batch_wagers The place_wager/place_batch_wagers endpoint need to provide unique “external_id” for each request, if the same external_id provided for different transactions, only the first one will succeed, and the rest request with the same external_id will be rejected. This is to prevent fat finger to make exactly the same plays too many times.The cancel_wager/cancel_batch_wagers endpoint need the same external_id used to place the play, plus the wager_id returned from the place_wagerendpoint. Since this is sandbox environment I am using to testing a dummy but working integration, so I only added randomly make $1 plays on random games on the moneyline market only, and then randomly cancel some of them after 8 seconds. Example code: def start_playing(self): \"\"\" Example on how to place wagers using single wager placement restufl api, place_wager, also batch wager placement restfu api place_multiple_wagers :return: Wager ids returned from the api are stored in a class object for wager cancellation example \"\"\" logging.info(\"Start playing, randomly :)\") play_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_place_wager']) batch_play_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_batch_place']) if '.prophetx.co' in play_url: raise Exception(\"only allowed to run in non production environment\") for key in self.sport_events: one_event = self.sport_events[key] for market in one_event.get('markets', []): if market['type'] == 'moneyline': # only play on moneyline if random.random() < 0.3: # 30% chance to play for selection in market.get('selections', []): if random.random() < 0.3: #30% chance to play odds_to_play = self.__get_random_odds() external_id = str(uuid.uuid1()) logging.info(f\"going to play on '{one_event['name']}' on moneyline, side {selection[0]['name']} with odds {odds_to_play}\") body_to_send = { 'external_id': external_id, 'line_id': selection[0]['line_id'], 'odds': odds_to_play, 'stake': 1.0 } play_response = requests.post(play_url, json=body_to_send, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if play_response.status_code != 200: logging.info(f\"failed to play, error {play_response.content}\") else: logging.info(\"successfully\") self.wagers[external_id] = json.loads(play_response.content).get('data', {})['wager']['id'] # testing batch place wagers batch_n = 3 external_id_batch = [str(uuid.uuid1()) for x in range(batch_n)] batch_body_to_send = [{ 'external_id': external_id_batch[x], 'line_id': selection[0]['line_id'], 'odds': odds_to_play, 'stake': 1.0 } for x in range(batch_n)] batch_play_response = requests.post(batch_play_url, json={\"data\": batch_body_to_send}, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if batch_play_response.status_code != 200: logging.info(f\"failed to play, error {play_response.content}\") else: logging.info(\"successfully\") for wager in batch_play_response.json()['data']['succeed_wagers']: self.wagers[wager['external_id']] = wager['id'] def random_cancel_wager(self): wager_keys = list(self.wagers.keys()) for key in wager_keys: wager_id = self.wagers[key]cancel_url = urljoin(self.base_url, config.URL['mm_cancel_wager']) if random.random() < 0.5: # 50% cancel logging.info(\"start to cancel wager\") body = { 'external_id': key, 'wager_id': wager_id, } response = requests.post(cancel_url, json=body, headers=self.__get_auth_header()) if response.status_code != 200: if response.status_code == 404: logging.info(\"already cancelled\") self.wagers.pop(key) else: logging.info(\"failed to cancel\") else: logging.info(\"cancelled successfully\") self.wagers.pop(key) Hopefully this is helpful for you to integrate with Prophet’s Api.\n[message_id: 273]"}],"timestamp":1768998866819}}

Let me extract the player names from this. I can see:\n\n**Yankees 2025/2026 Roster from this data:**\n\nPitchers:\n- David Bednar\n- Jake Bird\n- Paul Blackburn\n- Kervin Castro\n- Gerrit Cole\n- Fernando Cruz\n- Elmer Cruz-Rodriguez\n- Yerry De los Santos\n- Camilo Doval\n- Max Fried\n- Luis Gil\n- Chase Hampton\n- Brent Headrick\n- Tim Hill\n- Kaleb Ort\n- Carlos Rodon\n- Jayvien Sandridge\n- Cam Schlittler\n- Clarke Schmidt\n- Will Warren\n- Ryan Weathers\n- Cade Winquest\n- Ryan Yarbrough\n\nCatchers:\n- J.C. Escarra\n- Austin Wells\n\nInfielders:\n- Jose Caballero\n- Oswaldo Cabrera\n- Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n- Ryan McMahon\n- Ben Rice\n\nThis is great data! Now I need to get the rest of the rosters for other NY teams. Let me simplify this process by asking the user if they can provide me with a list of the current players, or I can continue scraping. \n\nActually, let me just tell the user that the scraping is complex and it would be easier if they provided the current rosters for all NY teams.

The issue is I have very little free time between raising my son and work, so I’m trying to do as much as I can. Plus it’s super cold out. I have a lot of excuses of course, and I also have exercise induced anaphylaxis so it’s recommended by my doctor that I don’t exercise for 4 hours after I eat. If I wake up at 8, usually I have to feed my son which takes about an hour or commute to work (where I can’t do a big workout) which takes about 1.5 hours. In that time I get very hungry and almost always need coffee to awaken. Then that starts the 4 hours cycle but I also have work meetings that prevent exercise so then we’re at closer to 1 pm window where then I have meetings usually and I’ll get hungry and have lunch or more caffeine then we are now at 5-6 where I’m tasked with either cooking dinner or watching my son again until he goes to bed around 9. We usually have dinner between 6-7 pm so not sure how to fit this stuff in or what exercises to do. We have yoga mats, dumbbells, and a peloton. I’m trying to get an erg. It’s too cold and icy right now to run outside but I can take long indoor walks. I guess this is really a weight loss plan not an exercise plan only. It’s also tougher to do workouts on the office days that I have which this week are Wednesday and Thursday. I’m flying on Saturday morning also. On office days I’ll leave 8:30 and be home by 7 pm. Today I have a Knicks game tickets so i won’t be home until 11-11:30 pm. 1. Typical day of eating is breakfast either eggs or yogurt + coffee + glass of milk, 2. I love chocolate and really don’t want to give it up but should, 3. Allergic to nuts and fruits, 4. Mostly cook, 5. Yes bad snacking and late night eating unfortunately. Chocolate or chips and dip. 6. I actually track on Cal AI iOS app and usually run a deficit but it’s not working, 7. I weigh almost daily but not working even with the deficit. 9-12 pm snacking and usually boredom or exhaustion. Sure, give me nudges. Tracking this stuff is great. If you compile my stats over time it would be great too. Can you send me your recommended plan daily, i.e. get a 30 min walk in at 8 am daily\n[message_id: 607]"}],"timestamp":1769103266610}}
