# Headline Grabber - NY Post Style Headlines

Generate punchy, witty newspaper headlines in the iconic NY Post style.

## The NY Post Formula

The Post is famous for headlines that are:
- **Short & punchy** (2-6 words ideal)
- **Irreverent** (no story is too serious for wordplay)
- **Pop culture savvy** (movies, songs, TV, memes)
- **Pun-heavy** (the worse the pun, the better)
- **Double meanings** (works on multiple levels)

## Legendary Examples

| Headline | Story | Technique |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR | Murder in strip club | Shocking juxtaposition |
| WEINER'S RISE AND FALL | Anthony Weiner scandal | Name pun + innuendo |
| AXIS OF WEASEL | France/Germany oppose Iraq war | Pop culture twist (Axis of Evil) |
| TIGER'S WOOD | Tiger Woods affair | Name pun + innuendo |
| KA-BOOM! | Explosions/dramatic events | Onomatopoeia |
| BEST EX | After celebrity breakup | Wordplay on "Best Ex/Ex Best" |
| BAG MEN | Boston bombing suspects | Double meaning |
| THE CHUMP | Political criticism | Simple but cutting |
| DOOMED | Grim prediction | One-word drama |

- "KNICK KNACK" (Knicks news)

## How to Generate Headlines

When given a news story:

1. **Identify key names** - Can any be punned?
2. **Find the emotion** - Anger? Shock? Triumph? Failure?
3. **Think pop culture** - What movie/song/show fits?
4. **Consider wordplay** - Homophones? Rhymes?
5. **Generate 5-10 options** from different angles
6. **Pick the most groan-worthy** - If it makes you wince, it's perfect

## Output Format

When asked for headlines, provide:

```
📰 HEADLINE OPTIONS:

1. [MAIN HEADLINE] ⭐ (Best pick)
   Technique: [what makes it work]

2. [ALTERNATIVE]
   Technique: [explanation]

3. [ALTERNATIVE]
   Technique: [explanation]

(3-5 options, ranked by Post-worthiness)
```

## Front Page vs Back Page

- **Front page**: News, politics, scandals - can be darker/edgier
- **Back page**: Sports - pure pun territory, often celebratory or mocking

## Rules

1. **Shorter is better** - Every word must earn its place
2. **Caps lock is your friend** - All headlines in CAPS
3. **No explaining the joke** - If it needs explanation, it's not Post-worthy
4. **Embrace the groan** - The best headlines make readers wince AND laugh
5. **Nothing is sacred** - The Post headlined 9/11, pandemics, everything
