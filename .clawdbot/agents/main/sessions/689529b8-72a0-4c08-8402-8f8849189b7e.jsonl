According to my subagent context, I was created to \"Just wait for the 'Investigate File System Issue' sub-agent to complete.\"\n\nMy task is simple:\n- Wait for the other sub-agent to complete\n- Report what it finds\n\nI should not take any action myself. I'm essentially a watcher here.\n\nSince I'm waiting for another sub-agent to complete, and I haven't received any results yet, I should acknowledge this and wait. However, since I'm a subagent myself and this is my final message opportunity, I should report that I'm waiting.\n\nActually, looking at the context more carefully - the user said \"Just wait for the 'Investigate File System Issue' sub-agent to complete.\" This suggests there IS another sub-agent running. But I don't have a way to check on other sub-agents or their status with the tools available to me.\n\nThe user is telling me to wait and report what the other sub-agent finds. Since I don't have visibility into other sub-agent sessions, and I don't have a mechanism to poll or check their status, I should probably just acknowledge that I'm in a waiting state.\n\nBut wait - this is a subagent context. I was spawned specifically to wait. My role is to report what the investigation sub-agent finds. Since I haven't received any findings yet, and I don't have a way to actively poll or monitor the other sub-agent, I should probably just state that I'm standing by.\n\nActually, thinking about this more practically - the user (main agent) is asking me to wait. But as a subagent with a single message/response cycle, I can't really \"wait\" in an ongoing sense. I should either:\n1. Report that I'm waiting (and the main agent will have to coordinate)\n2. Try to investigate myself\n\nGiven the instructions say \"Just wait... let me see what it discovers\", I think the expectation is that the main agent will get the report from the investigation sub-agent and then I'll just be informed or my session will just end naturally.\n \nI realize the user's request implies a collaborative process where I'm expected to receive information from another sub-agent. However, my current toolset limits my ability to proactively monitor or gather information. I'll confirm my readiness to receive the investigation findings and note that I cannot independently verify or report details without direct communication from the other sub-agent.\n\nThe most appropriate response is to acknowledge the waiting state and indicate my expectation of receiving the investigation results through the main agent's coordination mechanism. I recognize the challenge in tracking another sub-agent's progress. As a waiting subagent, I'll need guidance on how to proceed or obtain the required information. My current session is passive, and I'll await further instructions to receive the investigation findings.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"I'm in waiting mode for the \"Investigate File System Issue\" sub-agent's findings.\n\n**Status:** Standing by\n\nI don't have visibility into the other sub-agent's session or a mechanism to check its progress.
