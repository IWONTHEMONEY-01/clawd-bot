Based on the research, begin with:\n\n**Step 1: Data Pipeline Setup (NBA Focus)**\n- Create a Python project structure in /root/clawd/sports-betting/\n- Set up requirements.txt with: pandas, numpy, requests, nba_api, scikit-learn, xgboost\n- Create a data fetcher script to pull NBA game logs for the last 3 seasons\n- Store data in a structured format (CSV or database)\n\n**Step 2: Feature Engineering**\n- Implement rolling averages (3, 5, 10 game windows)\n- Add opponent strength metrics\n- Include situational flags (rest days, home/away)\n- Create usage rate calculations\n\n**Step 3: First Model**\n- Build a simple linear regression model for NBA points props\n- Use walk-forward validation (train on past, test on future)\n- Calculate basic performance metrics (MAE, calibration)\n\nCreate the project structure and start building. Focus on getting something working that we can iterate on.\n\nSave all code to /root/clawd/sports-betting/ directory."}],"timestamp":1769576374683}}
