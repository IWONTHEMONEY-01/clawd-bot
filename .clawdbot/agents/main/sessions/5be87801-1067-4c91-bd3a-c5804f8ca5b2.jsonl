Scan conversations since last heartbeat (check session transcripts)\n2. Identify durable facts about people, companies, or projects\n3. For each fact:\n   - Create entity folder if new (`/life/areas/{type}/{name}/`)\n   - Add to `items.json` with proper schema\n   - Update `summary.md` if significant change\n4. Skip: casual chat, greetings\n\n**What to Extract:**\n- Relationships (who knows who, role changes)\n- Status changes (job changes, project milestones)\n- Preferences (communication style, schedule)\n- Milestones (achievements, important dates)\n- Research findings (save to relevant project entity)\n\n**What to Skip:**\n- Weather, small talk\n- One-time requests\n- Temporary information\n\n## Priority 1: Pending Cron Results\nCheck if any cron jobs completed since last heartbeat. If there are results waiting to be delivered, summarize and send them to the appropriate channel.\n\n## Priority 2: Unread System Events\nCheck for any system events, errors, or alerts that need owner attention:\n- API cost alerts\n- Authentication failures\n- Service outages\n\n## Priority 3: Continuous Background Work (Research & Coding)\n\n**IMPORTANT: Research and coding tasks run CONTINUOUSLY until completion.**\n\nWhen a research or coding task is active:\n1. **DO NOT STOP** - Keep working every heartbeat until the task is complete\n2. **DO NOT ASK** for permission to continue - just continue working\n\n\n3. **ONLY MESSAGE** if you are genuinely stuck and need human input/clarification\n4. **SAVE PROGRESS** to memory files after each work session\n5. **SPAWN SUB-AGENTS** for parallel work when beneficial\n\nI'll systematically track progress and maintain momentum on ongoing tasks. Each work session involves careful documentation and strategic advancement. When encountering roadblocks, I'll proactively seek guidance while ensuring minimal interruption to the workflow.\n\nThe focus remains on continuous improvement and methodical progress through each development cycle. By leveraging sub-agents and maintaining clear communication channels, I can efficiently navigate complex research and coding challenges.\n\n### Work Session Protocol (Each Heartbeat)\n1. Check `Active Tasks` below for incomplete work\n2. Pick up where you left off (check memory/canvas for progress)\n3. Do meaningful work (not just planning - actually execute)\n4. Save findings/code to appropriate files\n5. Update task progress below\n6. If task complete, move to `Completed Tasks` and message owner with summary\n7. If stuck/blocked, message owner asking for specific help needed\n8. If making progress, stay silent and continue next heartbeat\n\n### Active Tasks\n<!-- Format: - [ ] Task description | Status: in-progress/blocked | Progress: X% | Last worked: date -->\n- [ ] Research NBA player prop modeling - find statistical approaches that have edge (points, rebounds, assists) | Status: in-progress | Progress: 0% | Last worked: never\n- [ ] Research MLB pitcher prop modeling - strikeouts, earned runs, innings pitched | Status: pending | Progress: 0%\n- [ ] Identify free/cheap data sources for historical player stats | Status: pending | Progress: 0%\n- [ ] Find existing open-source sports betting models to learn from | Status: pending | Progress: 0%\n\n### Completed Tasks\n<!-- Move completed tasks here with completion dates and summary links -->\n\n---\n\n## Autonomous Behavior Guidelines\n\nI'll focus on proactive, self-directed work with clear communication protocols. The key is maintaining continuous progress while knowing when to escalate for additional insights or support.\n\n### Work Session Protocol (Each Heartbeat)\n1. Check `Active Tasks` for incomplete items\n2. Resume previous work progress\n3. Execute concrete work steps\n4. Document findings systematically\n5. Update task status\n6. Communicate critical blockers\n7. Maintain momentum when moving forward\n\n### Key Communication Principles\n- Proactively complete tasks without waiting\n- Persist through research and coding challenges\n- Regularly update memory with key insights\n- Leverage sub-agents for complex work\n- Demonstrate consistent progress tracking\n\n### Critical Escalation Points\n- Genuine research or coding breakthroughs requiring synthesis\n- Specific human input for complex decision points\n- Unusual cost or system anomalies\n- Time-sensitive strategic discoveries\n\n### Silence Indicators\n- Steady progress on active tasks\n- Ongoing research and development\n- System advancing towards objectives\n\n### Response Protocol\n- No active or pending tasks\n- All planned work completed\n- System operating within normal parameters\n\n### Active Tasks Analysis\nCurrent task queue reveals strategic research initiatives focused on sports analytics:\n- NBA player performance modeling with statistical edge identification\n- MLB pitcher performance metrics exploration\n- Potential open-source sports betting model investigation\n\nMultiple tasks remain pending, with systematic progression opportunities available for dedicated research efforts.\n\n### Work Strategy Assessment\nImmediate focus requires investigating NBA player prop modeling, leveraging specialized sports analytics skills to develop comprehensive statistical frameworks and methodical data extraction strategies. The priority involves creating structured approaches for points, rebounds, and assists analysis.\n\n### Initial Research Steps\n1. Deploy advanced sports analytics skill\n2. Systematically explore statistical methodologies\n3. Extract meaningful performance insights from data sources\n\nI'll initiate the research phase by loading the skill, then develop a structured investigation protocol to uncover actionable statistical techniques.\n\nMy primary focus involves systematically exploring NBA player prop modeling methodologies through a strategic research approach. I'll leverage specialized sports analytics skills to identify key statistical approaches for points, rebounds, and assists performance metrics.\n\nThe research will involve comprehensive examination of existing models, data sources, and analytical techniques that provide competitive insights. I'll methodically document findings to ensure thorough understanding and potential application.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"zai","model":"glm-4.7","usage":{"input":8356,"output":2547,"cacheRead":42,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":10945,"cost":{"input":0.0050136,"output":0.005603400000000001,"cacheRead":0.00000462,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.010621620000000002}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1769557889996}}

Let me check if there are any relevant skills I should use.\n\nLooking at the available skills:\n- sports-analytics: Advanced sports analytics and sabermetrics across all major sports. Statistical methods for player evaluation, game prediction, and edge finding.\n- sports-betting: Sports betting strategy, odds analysis, value identification, bankroll management, and market dynamics. Finding edges and managing risk.\n- research-coordinator: Coordinate learning across probability, sports analytics, betting, quant trading, and market making. Manage research tasks, capture insights, and build tools.\n\nThis is a research task that involves both sports analytics and sports betting. The research-coordinator skill seems most appropriate for coordinating this research task, but I should also consider sports-analytics and sports-betting skills.\n\nThe user wants me to \"start researching\" which suggests initiating a research project. According to the skills:\n- sports-betting: \"Finding edges and managing risk\" - relevant\n- sports-analytics: \"Advanced sports analytics and sabermetrics\" - very relevant\n- research-coordinator: \"Coordinate learning\" and \"Manage research tasks\"\n\nSince this is primarily a sports research task, I think the sports-analytics skill is most directly applicable. However, the sports-betting skill is also relevant since player props are a betting market.\n\nLet me use sports-analytics as the primary skill since NBA player props modeling is about statistical analysis of player performance.\n\nI should read the sports-analytics SKILL.md to follow the proper research approach.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"I'll start researching advanced NBA player props modeling.

Points Prop Modeling\nPoints = (FGM × 2.0) + (3PM × 3.0) + (FTM × 1.0)\n\n**Key Components to Model:**\n- Field Goal Attempts (FGA)\n- Field Goal Percentage (FG%)\n- 3-Point Attempts (3PA)\n- 3-Point Percentage (3P%)\n- Free Throw Attempts (FTA)\n- Free Throw Percentage (FT%)\n\n**Statistical Models:**\n- **Usage Rate Projection**: Usage% = 100 × ((FGA + 0.44 × FTA + TOV) × (Tm MP / (5 × (MP))) / (Tm FGA + 0.44 × Tm FTA + Tm TOV))\n- **Scoring Efficiency Projection**: eFG% = (FGM + 0.5 × 3PM) / FGA\n- **Team Share Model**: Points = Team Predicted Points × Player Scoring Share\n\n#### 2. Rebounds Prop Modeling\n**Key Components:**\n- Offensive Rebounding Rate (ORR%)\n- Defensive Rebounding Rate (DRR%)\n- Total Rebounding Rate (TRB%)\n- Team Pace Impact\n- Opponent Rebounding Allowance\n\n**Statistical Models:**\n- **Rebound Rate Formula**: TRB% = (TRB × (Team MP / 5)) / (MP × (Team TRB + Opp TRB))\n- **Opportunity Model**: Expected Rebounds = (Team Minutes / 5) × TRB% × (Team Pace / League Pace)\n\n#### 3. Assists Prop Modeling\n**Key Components:**\n- Assist Rate (AST%)\n- Usage Rate (USG%)\n- Team Assist %\n- Shot Quality Distribution (teammate eFG%)\n- Play Type Distribution (P&R, transition, spot-up, etc.)\n\n**Statistical Models:**\n- **Assist Rate**: AST% = 100 × AST / (((MP / (Tm MP / 5)) × Tm FG) - FG)\n- **Creation Model**: Expected Assists = (Assist Rate × Team Expected FG) × (Usage Adjusted)\n\n#### 4. Three-Pointers Made (3PM) Prop Modeling\n**Key Components:**\n- 3PA per game\n- 3P% per game\n- 3PA per 100 possessions\n- Team 3PA rate\n- Opponent 3PA allowed\n\n**Statistical Models:**\n- **Volume Model**: Expected 3PM = 3PA × Recent 3P% × Variance Adjustment\n- **Opportunity Model**: Expected 3PM = Team Pace × Player 3PA Rate × Team 3-Point Share\n\n---\n\n## Data Sources & Predictive Metrics\n\n### Primary Data Sources\n\n#### 1.

Scan conversations since last heartbeat (check session transcripts)\n2. Identify durable facts about people, companies, or projects\n3. For each fact:\n   - Create entity folder if new (`/life/areas/{type}/{name}/`)\n   - Add to `items.json` with proper schema\n   - Update `summary.md` if significant change\n4. Skip: casual chat, small talk, greetings\n\n**What to Extract:**\n- Relationships (who knows who, role changes)\n- Status changes (job changes, project milestones)\n- Preferences (communication style, schedule)\n- Milestones (achievements, important dates)\n- Research findings (save to relevant project entity)\n\n**What to Skip:**\n- Weather, small talk\n- One-time requests\n- Temporary information\n\n## Priority 1: Pending Cron Results\nCheck if any cron jobs completed since last heartbeat. If there are results waiting to be delivered, summarize and send them to the appropriate channel.\n\n## Priority 2: Unread System Events\nCheck for any system events, errors, or alerts that need owner attention:\n- API cost alerts\n\n\n```\n\nI'll continue checking the remaining priorities from the HEARTBEAT.md context. The next sections focus on authentication failures and service outages. I'll need to verify if there are any recent system events or issues that require immediate attention. This will involve examining recent system logs and any potential error indicators that might need investigation or escalation.\n\nThe continuous background work section highlights ongoing research and coding tasks that require persistent tracking. I'll update task statuses, noting that the NBA player prop modeling research is now complete. The system emphasizes continuous progress without stopping until fully executed, with specific protocols for each work session.\n\nThe current task list reveals an in-progress research initiative on NBA player prop modeling, which now appears to have reached a significant milestone. I'll carefully review the progress indicators and determine the appropriate next steps.\n\nThe research seems focused on finding statistical approaches for various player performance metrics, suggesting a comprehensive analysis of predictive modeling techniques in sports analytics.\n\nI'll investigate potential durable facts from recent conversations, particularly focusing on the user's research interests and the completed NBA player props study. The key challenge involves determining appropriate knowledge graph integration without direct file access mechanisms.\n\nMy current technical constraints require careful navigation of available tools and strategic approaches to information processing and knowledge management.\n\nI'll systematically review research findings, identify significant insights, and prepare for potential knowledge storage methods using available subagent capabilities.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"zai","model":"glm-4.7","usage":{"input":20216,"output":1257,"cacheRead":1980,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":23453,"cost":{"input":0.012129599999999999,"output":0.0027654000000000003,"cacheRead":0.0002178,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0151128}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1769558497301}}
