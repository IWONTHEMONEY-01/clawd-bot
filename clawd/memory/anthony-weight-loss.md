# Anthony's Weight Loss Plan

**Start Date:** 2026-01-21
**Starting Weight:** 239 lbs
**Goal Weight:** 210 lbs
**Timeline:** 5-7 months

## Key Constraints
- Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (4 hour post-meal buffer)
- Allergic to nuts and fruits
- Limited time (work + raising son)
- Office days: Wed/Thu typically (8:30a-7p)
- Son bedtime: ~9 PM
- Dinner: 6-7 PM

## Equipment Available
- Peloton
- Dumbbells
- Yoga mats
- Indoor walking
- Trying to get an erg

## The Real Problem
- Late night snacking 9 PM - midnight
- Triggers: boredom, exhaustion after son goes to bed
- Snacks: chocolate, chips and dip
- Tracking deficit on Cal.ai but not seeing results = undertracking snacks

## Current Eating
- Breakfast: eggs or yogurt + coffee + milk
- Loves chocolate (keep but control)
- Mostly cooks (good!)
- Tracks on Cal.ai

## The Plan

### Nutrition (80% of the battle)
1. Track EVERYTHING - especially late night snacks
2. Budget 150-200 cal/day for chocolate (portion controlled)
3. Swap chips for: popcorn, veggies + hummus, cheese, jerky
4. Kitchen closes at 9 PM
5. Brush teeth at 9 PM (signals done eating)

### Evening Routine (the key fix)
- Son to bed 9 PM
- Brush teeth immediately after
- Tea/water only after 9 PM
- Bed by 10:30 PM
- Replace snacking with: sleep, games, shows, reading

### Exercise (20% of the battle)
- Realistic: 2-3x/week
- Best window: fasted morning (8-8:25 AM before eating)
- Office days: 15 min fasted if possible, otherwise rest day
- Options: Peloton, dumbbells, yoga, indoor walks
