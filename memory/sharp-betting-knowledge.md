## Billy Walters - The Greatest Sports Bettor

### Who He Is
Billy Walters is widely considered the greatest sports bettor of all time. Over a 30+ year career, he's reported to have made billions of dollars in bets, with lifetime winnings of $150 million to $500 million+.

### Background
- Grew up poor in Murray, Kentucky
- Dropped out of high school, worked various jobs
- Discovered betting in the 1980s after a car accident left him bedridden
- Started with small bets, developed his method over time

### The Walters Method
1. **Data-Driven Before It Was Cool** - One of the first bettors to build sophisticated statistical models. Collected massive amounts of data - weather, injuries, travel, historical matchups - to find edges the books missed.

2. **Position Sizing**:
   - Bet small when uncertain (1-2% of bankroll)
   - Bet large when models showed clear edge (up to 10%+)
   - Never chase losses - this was his cardinal rule
   - Treated betting like a business, not entertainment

3. **Discipline Above All**:
   - Woke up at 5 AM daily to study lines
   - Maintained routines regardless of win/loss
   - Avoided alcohol and distractions during betting periods
   - Knew when to walk away from bad markets

### Walters' Key Lessons
1. "The market is always right" - lines move for a reason
2. Be patient and wait for your edge
3. Bankroll management is more important than picks
4. Emotional control separates pros from amateurs
5. Study the market, not just the games

### Famous Quotes
- "I'd rather have a small edge that I can bet heavily than a big edge I can't bet."
- "Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even when you don't want to do it."
- "The goal isn't to win every bet. It's to make the right decisions over time."

## Rufus Peabody - The Modern Sharp

### Who He Is
Rufus Peabody is one of the most well-known modern sharp bettors. Unlike Walters who operated in secrecy, Peabody has been public about his methods, track record, and approach. Known for his model-driven, analytical betting style.

### Background
- Mathematics background (PhD-level thinking)
- Founded Peabody's Picks (subscription service)
- Bets publicly tracked on sites like BettingPros/YouTube
- Known for betting limits and getting banned from books

### His Core Approach
1. **Statistical Modeling** - Builds mathematical models that assign probabilities to outcomes. Incorporates team efficiency ratings, home/away splits, rest days, weather, historical matchup data.

2. **Market Efficiency Theory** - Believes most markets are efficient most of the time. Edge comes from:
   - Finding specific inefficiencies (props, lesser-known leagues)
   - Exploiting public bias (betting against popular teams)
   - Being faster than the books on new information

3. **Public vs. Sharp Money** - Tracks where "sharp" money goes vs. "public" money. Often fades the public.

### What Makes Him Different
- Transparent about his process
- Shows both wins AND losses
- Focuses on process over results
- Believes in long-term expected value

### Key Insights
1. "Process over results" - good process yields good results over time
2. Track everything - you can't improve what you don't measure
3. Know your edge before you bet
4. The public is usually wrong on popular teams
5. Props and derivatives are often less efficient than sides/totals

### Famous Statement
"The market prices in most information. Your edge comes from finding what it hasn't priced in yet."

## Line Movement - Reading the Market

### What Line Movement Tells You
The betting line isn't just a number - it's information. Sharp bettors study line movement like traders study stock charts.

### Types of Line Movement

1. **Steam Moves** - When a large amount of money comes in quickly on one side, the line moves fast. This often indicates sharp action.

2. **Reverse Line Movement** - When the majority of public bets are on Team A but the line moves toward Team B, sharp money is likely on Team B.

3. **Line Traps** - Sometimes books set a "trap" line - a number designed to look attractive but is actually bad value.

### Why Lines Move
1. New information (injury, weather)
2. Sharp money - professional bettors betting large amounts
3. Public betting patterns - books adjusting for liability
4. Steam moves - herding behavior among bettors

### Reading the Market
- Track opening line vs. current line
- Note when/why movement happened
- Compare lines across multiple books
- Ask: "Why did the line move this way?"

### Key Principle
"The sharp money speaks through line movement. Listen to it."

## Core Sharp Betting Principles

1. **Bankroll Management > Picks** - How you bet matters more than what you bet
2. **Process Over Results** - A losing bet can be a good bet if the process was sound
3. **Emotional Discipline** - Never chase, never tilt, never deviate from your system
4. **Market Respect** - The line is information; respect what it tells you
5. **Edge Identification** - Know WHY you have an edge before betting
6. **Long-term Thinking** - Individual bets don't matter; expected value over thousands of bets does
