# Anthony's Weight Loss Plan

**Start Date:** 2026-01-21
**Starting Weight:** 239 lbs
**Goal Weight:** 210 lbs
**Timeline:** 5-7 months

## Daily Step Goal
- **Target:** 8,000 steps/day (Anthony's realistic goal)

## Key Constraints
- Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (4 hour post-meal buffer)
- Allergic to nuts and fruits
- Limited time (work + raising son)
- Office days: Wed/Thu typically (8:30a-7p)
- Son bedtime: ~9 PM
- Dinner: 6-7 PM

## The Real Problem (INVERSION IDENTIFIED)
Anthony's 3 failure modes:
1. **Late night sweets + overdoing calories** 9 PM - midnight
2. **Not exercising at all in any given week**
3. **Not getting daily steps in**

## The Plan

### Nutrition (80% of the battle)
1. Kitchen closes at 9 PM (brush teeth = signal)
2. Budget 150-200 cal/day for chocolate (portion controlled)
3. Track EVERYTHING on Cal.ai (including night snacks)
4. 8K steps daily minimum

### Exercise (20% of the battle)
- Realistic: 2 workouts/week minimum
- Best window: fasted morning (8-8:25 AM before eating)
- Office days: rest days or 15 min if possible
