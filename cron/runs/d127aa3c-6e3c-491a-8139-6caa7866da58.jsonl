It's Friday check-in time for your weight loss journey 📊\n\nHere are your weekly questions:\n\n1️⃣ **How did the week go with evening snacking?** Did the 9 PM kitchen close rule stick? Any late-night chocolate moments?\n\n2️⃣ **What's your weight today?** Time for that weekly weigh-in!\n\n3️⃣ **Any workouts completed this week?** Remember, the goal is 2 minimum - fasted morning workouts before 8:25 AM are your sweet spot.\n\n4️⃣ **📸 IMPORTANT:** Please send me a Cal.ai screenshot or your weekly calorie average! This is crucial data for tracking - don't skip it!\n\nBe honest about the good, the bad, and the snacking.
